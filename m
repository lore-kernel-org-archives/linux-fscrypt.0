This is standard HKDF-SHA512; only the choice of parameters is fscrypt-specific.
So it could indeed use a common implementation of HKDF if one were available.

However, I don't think there are any other HKDF users in the kernel currently.
Also, while there was a patch to support HKDF via the crypto_rng API, there was
no consensus about whether this was actually the best way to add KDF support:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-crypto/2423373.Zd5ThvQH5g@positron.chronox.de

So for now, to avoid unnecessarily blocking this patchset I think we should just
go with this implementation in fs/crypto/.  It can always be changed later, once
we decide on the best way to add KDFs to the crypto API.

[To be clear: this patch already uses "hmac(sha512)" from the crypto API.  It's
only the actual HKDF part that we're talking about here.

Also, its correctness is tested by the ciphertext verification xfstests.]
