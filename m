Correct, normally userspace should wipe its copy of the key immediately after
adding it to the kernel.  I'll clarify that here.

Yes, but that's a larger issue.  Unencrypted data can be written to swap and
then be recovered from disk offline.  This has nothing to do with whether the
key is ever removed on-line or not.  So swap really could use its own mention
somewhere else, maybe in the "Offline attacks" section.

As mentioned in a previous reply, they *can* trick other users into using that
incorrect key, by opening files using that incorrect key.  The incorrect key is
then cached for everyone.  (This assumes the other users have at least read
access to the file.  If it's mode 0700, this won't work.)

I think we should go with "must" instead of "should".

Basically the point of this paragraph is to explain that the API takes a real
cryptographic key of the full given length.

Otherwise the security guarantees for the algorithms the master key may be used
in (AES-128-ECB KDF, HKDF-SHA512, or Adiantum) aren't guaranteed to hold.

One can argue about how much of a problem this actually is, like how unsalted
HKDF on a key with unevenly distributed entropy is *probably* fine in practice
(and much better than the AES-128-ECB KDF).  But the security proof for unsalted
HKDF actually still assumes a pseudorandom key.  It's only randomly salted HKDF
that doesn't.

I'd strongly prefer to go with *must* for things that are necessary for the
security proofs or cryptanalysis to apply, even if they *might* still be "good
enough" in practice.

I'll try to find a better way to word this paragraph.

Probably, but we don't know for sure.  It's theoretically possible that
cryptanalysis of two cryptographic primitives A and B, where they are each given
the same key, could be much easier than attacking A or B individually.

So again, I'd prefer to go with *must not* for things where there is no theory
of cryptography that says it is okay, even if *probably* someone could get away
with doing it in practice.
