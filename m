This should be "== FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_INDENTIFIER" instead.  That's
because you use the identifier part of the union:

If we ever add a new key specifier type, and alternative in the union,
this is going to come back to bite us.

Which scenario do you have in mind?  With read-only access, Alice can
fetch the encryption policy for a directory, and introduce a key with
the same descriptor, but the "wrong" key, but that's only going to
affect Alice's use of the key.  It won't affect what key is used by
Bob, since Alice doesn't have write access to Bob's keyrings.

If what you mean is the risk when there is a single global
filesystem-specific keyring, where Alice could introduce a "wrong" key
identified with a specific descriptor, then sure, Alice could trick
Bob into encrypting his data with the wrong key (one known to Alice).
But we don't allow keys usable by V1 policies to be used in the
filesystem-specific keyring, do we?
