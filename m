Thanks for the review.  Good point; I think we should just go with the "always
round up to the next 64K boundary" method.  Special-casing how the last page
gets mmap()ed seems it would be really painful.

Since there can be a hole between the end of the file and the start of the
verity metadata, this doesn't even necessarily use any additional disk space.

For consistency and since there is little downside I think I'll do the same for
f2fs too, though f2fs doesn't currently support PAGE_SIZE != 4096 at all anyway.
