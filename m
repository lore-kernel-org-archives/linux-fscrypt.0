Just to confirm for the layman reader - the fact that the crypto keys
are registered with the filesystem and not with the user process doesn't
prevent user(s) from having different crypto keys for different subdirs
in a single filesystem?

Secondly, does this progress fscrypt toward allowing multiple master =
keys
to decrypt a single per-file key?
