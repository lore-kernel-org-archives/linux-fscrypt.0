Well, I did it this way because the next patch changes the code to:

	if (arg.key_spec.type == FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR) {
		...
	} else {
		...
	}

We already validated that it's either TYPE_DESCRIPTOR or TYPE_IDENTIFIER.

But I guess to be more clear I'll just make it handle the default case again.

	switch (arg.key_spec.type) {
	case FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_DESCRIPTOR:
		...
		break;
	case FSCRYPT_KEY_SPEC_TYPE_IDENTIFIER:
		...
		break;
	default:
		err = -EINVAL;
		break;
	}

The scenario is that Alice lists the directory with the wrong key, then Bob
lists the directory too and gets the wrong filenames.  This happens because the
inode, fscrypt_info, dentry cache, page cache, etc. are the same for everyone.
Bob's key is never looked up because the inode already has a key cached.

This also applies to regular files and symlinks.
