From: Eric Biggers <ebiggers@google.com>

When a filesystem encryption key is removed, we need all files which had
been "unlocked" (had ->i_crypt_info set up) with it to appear "locked"
again.  This is most easily done by evicting the inodes.  This can
currently be done using 'echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches'; however,
that is overkill and not usable by non-root users.

To evict just the needed inodes we also need the ability to evict those
inodes' dentries, since an inode is pinned by its dentries.  Therefore,
add a function shrink_dcache_inode() which iterates through an inode's
dentries and evicts any unused ones as well as any unused descendants
(since there may be negative dentries pinning the inode's dentries).
