The solution is still so gross. Exporting all the inode cache
internal functions so you can invalidate an external list of inodes
is, IMO, not an appropriate solution for anything.

Indeed, this is exactly what ->drop_inode() is for.

Take this function:

It takes a new reference to each decrypted inode, and then drops it
again after all the dentry cache references have been killed and
we've got a reference to the next inode in the list.  Killing the
dentry references to the inode means it should only have in-use
references and the reference this function holds on it.

If the inode is not in use then there will be only one, and so it
will fall into iput_final() and the ->drop_inode() function
determines if the inode should be evicted from the cache and
destroyed immediately.  IOWs, implement fscrypt_drop_inode() to do
the right thing when the key has been destroyed, and you can get rid
of all this crazy inode cache walk-and-invalidate hackery.

Cheers,

Dave.
