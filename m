Correct, that hasn't changed.  Different directories can use different keys.

It's not a goal of this patchset as no one has really been asking for it yet.
Per-file keys are still derived from the master key.

Note that it's already possible to wrap the master keys in userspace.  Thus you
can already have multiple passwords that unlock the same encrypted directory.
You just can't do this with *individual files*.  Maybe that's good enough.

However, this patchset does fix the denial of service vulnerabilities that
currently exist when users share an encrypted directory.  Also, since it adds a
real KDF, it makes it much easier to derive a wrapping key to wrap the per-file
keys if that were to become a requirement.  (The master key could be used as the
wrapping key directly, but that's inflexible and more error-prone.)
