Keep in mind that the new ioctls (FS_IOC_ADD_ENCRYPTION_KEY,
FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY, FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS) don't take the
keyring ID as a parameter, since it's already known from the filesystem the
ioctl is executed on.  So there actually isn't much that can be done with the
keyring ID.  But sure, if it's needed later we can add an API to get it.

I'll add a brief comment that explains the key specifier.

I've already added a pointer to Documentation/filesystems/fscrypt.rst at the top
of the header (this was one of the cleanups in v6 => v7):

/*
 * fscrypt user API
 *
 * These ioctls can be used on filesystems that support fscrypt.  See the
 * "User API" section of Documentation/filesystems/fscrypt.rst.
