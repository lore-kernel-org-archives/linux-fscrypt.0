I want to keep it as WARN_ON() because if it happens it's a kernel bug, and
WARNs are reported as bugs by automated tools.  But I can do the following so it
returns an error code too:

Empty files would have to be special-cased, e.g. defining the root hash to be
all 0's, since there are no blocks to checksum.  It would be straightforward,
but it would still be a special case, e.g.:

diff --git a/fs/verity/enable.c b/fs/verity/enable.c
index ee9dd578e59fb..e859a2b6a4310 100644
--- a/fs/verity/enable.c
+++ b/fs/verity/enable.c
@@ -112,6 +112,12 @@ static int build_merkle_tree(struct inode *inode,

+		memset(root_hash, 0, params->digest_size);
+		return 0;
+	}
+

On the other hand, *not* supporting empty files is a special case from the
user's point of view.  It means that fs-verity isn't supported on every possible
file.  Thinking about it, that's probably worse than having a special case in
the *implementation*.

So now I'm leaning towards changing it to support empty files.
