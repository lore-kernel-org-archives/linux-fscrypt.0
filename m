Thanks for the feedback!  If I understand correctly, your suggestion is:

- Keep evict_dentries_for_decrypted_inodes() as-is, i.e. fscrypt would still
  evict the dentries for all inodes in ->mk_decrypted_inodes.
  (I don't see how it could work otherwise.)

- However, evict_decrypted_inodes() would be removed and fscrypt would not
  directly evict the list of inodes.  Instead, the filesystem's ->drop_inode()
  would be made to return 1 if the inode's master key has been removed.  Thus
  each inode, if no longer in use, would end up getting evicted during the
  iput() in evict_dentries_for_decrypted_inodes().

I hadn't thought of this, and I think it would work; I'll try implementing it.
It would also have the advantage that if a key is removed while an inode is
still in-use, that inode will be evicted as soon as it's no longer in use rather
than waiting around until another FS_IOC_REMOVE_ENCRYPTION_KEY.

The ioctl will need a different way to determine whether any inodes couldn't be
evicted, but simply checking whether ->mk_decrypted_inodes ended up empty or not
should work.

FWIW, originally I also considered leaving the inodes in the inode cache and
instead only freeing ->i_crypt_info and truncating the pagecache.  But I don't
see a way to do it even with this new idea; for one, ->drop_inode() is called
under ->i_lock.  So it seems that eviction is still the way to go.
