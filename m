Returning 0 when the key wasn't fully removed might also be confusing.  But I
guess you're right that returning an error doesn't match how syscalls usually
work.  It did remove the current user's usage of the key, after all, rather than
completely fail.  And as you point out, if someone cares about other users
having added the key, they can use FS_IOC_GET_ENCRYPTION_KEY_STATUS.

So I guess I'll change it to 0.

Thanks!
